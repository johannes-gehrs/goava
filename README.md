# Goava

This is a toy project to explore Go generics. Totally WIP.

The idea is to create an in memory cache similar to Java's popular Guava cache.

Generics make a lot of sense for that kind of use case.


## How to build and test

- [Install](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip) `gotip`
- Run `make test`
